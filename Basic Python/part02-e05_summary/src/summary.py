# Exercise 2.5 (summary)
# This exercise can give two points at maximum!

# Part 1.

# Create a function called summary that gets a filename as a parameter. The input file should contain a floating point number on each line of the file. Make your function read these numbers and then return a triple containing the sum, average, and standard deviation of these numbers for the file.

# The main function should call the function summary for each filename in the list sys.argv[1:] of command line parameters. (Skip sys.argv[0] since it contains the name of the current program.)

# Example of usage from the command line: python3 src/summary.py src/example.txt src/example2.txt

# Print floating point numbers using six decimals precision. The output should look like this:

# File: src/example.txt Sum: 51.400000 Average: 10.280000 Stddev: 8.904606
# File: src/example2.txt Sum: 5446.200000 Average: 1815.400000 Stddev: 3124.294045
# Part 2.

# If some line doesnâ€™t represent a number, you can just ignore that line. You can achieve this with the try-except block. An example of recovering from an exceptional situation:


# try:
#     x = float(line)           # The float constructor raises ValueError exception if conversion is no possible
# except ValueError:
#     # Statements in here are executed when the above conversion fails
# We will cover more about exceptions later in the course.
